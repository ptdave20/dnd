As the people in the room and the group began to process what had happened. Albon reappeared and ordered his minions to seize the young woman who came from the carafe.  They dragged her away towards stairs in the back of the unknowing.  The group gathered together and pursued.  Reaching the top of the stairs, they arrived and entered Albon's private chamber.  A magnificent room with all manner of artifacts and relics.  The group was approached by some of Albon's minions who attempted to force them out.  The party engaged them.  Albon seemed distracted during most of the battle, but then Trenton killed his familiar and he now seems to be more focused on what is occurring.
