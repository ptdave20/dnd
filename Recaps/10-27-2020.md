The group fought with Albon who seemed distracted by some information he was having trouble locating.  The party continued to fight and was eventually able to kill Albon's two apprentices.  After this, they engaged Albon directly and after a difficult battle, Brandon channeled the power of his ax and was able to strike Albon directly in the red gem embedded in his forehead.  The gem cracked and Albon was ripped apart by a beholder who was residing in or behind the gem.  The beholder was kind enough to not slay the weakened party directly, but he seemed put off by the fact that they broke his gem.  He demanded the group acquire him a new gem before he is willing to discuss with them any further.
