The party cautiously entered the complex and began to explore.  Shortly after entering, Brandong set off a trap and was assaulted by a Naga who had hidden in ambush.  A skirmish ensued with the party slowly driving the Naga back, while the Naga worked to impede and damage the attackers.  The Naga employed several tricks and traps, including illusions and domination until she retreated into reinforcements.  A second Naga entered the fight and the two were able to surround and knock Brandong out of the fight.  The rest of the party regrouped and planned their next steps..
