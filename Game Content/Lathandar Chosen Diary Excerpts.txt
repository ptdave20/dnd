My worst fears have come true.  It is foul enough that our beloved emperor has decided to engage in vile rituals to make himself into an evil undead monstrosity but the means he has chosen could not be more horrendous.  The ritual his advisors are implementing even now, will draw the life energy from all around him, creating a monster's who's power is based on the type and number of poor souls sacrificed.  It is a wonder to me what could possibly have brought our great leader to pursue such things

I have counseled the emperor again against continuing on this path.  He seems resolute.  It is obvious to me that the great torment that devastated the north weighs heavily on him.  I feel for the struggle he must be going through to see an empire, which seems at times to be as eternal as the mountains stricken so.  Doshor will recover though, but he can't seem to see past the current times.  I will continue to try to dissuade him, but I fear nothing will help, as it appears he has already sent forth for the greatest and most capable warriors.  His intention appears to be to sacrifice the strongest warriors in the empire in the hopes that he will become as powerful as the tales of the ancient god-kings of Doshor.  I have beseeched Domnul Inviere for guidance, but he has been silent to my prayers, ever since the torment.  It seems even my God has been affected by the great tragedy of the tormented wastes.  A land once brimming with life, reduced to ruin in the space of a few short years.  Peace on the souls lost.

I must travel to the palace immediately.  During morning rites, Domnul Inviere spoke to me and opened my eyes to a devastating truth.  The grand palace of Sa'Dasrakh is a mighty building, enchanted by some of the greatest wizards to ever live.  The emperor intends to complete the ritual within this building.  I now believe that the power of the palace itself will serve to strengthen and focus the magic of the ritual.  The results could be far beyond what is intended.  I worry that it is too late for the emperor.  I have heard no news from the city for several days and I worry that it is likely that his advisors have already begun the ritual.  This means that when I arrive, I will likely find that the emperor has already been disemboweled alive in preparation for the final steps of the ritual.  Nothing can be done for him at this point.  It is better that he die, then this ritual be allowed to finish.  I must do whatever I can to stop those performing the rites even if it means my death.  The fate of our grand empire of Doshor and perhaps people of the city or even the world are at stake.  I pray to Inviere for strength.  May his morning light guide my steps and strengthen my hand.
