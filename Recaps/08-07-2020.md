The party arrived at the ice encrusted ruin and discovered that a pair of dangerous Naga were patrolling the entrance.  An initial attempt at communication went poorly but soon after that, Brandong proved himself far superior at stealth then Callie and was able to sneak into the complex.  The inside was dark and appeared to be in a state of collapse.  Outside, Mirthal got bored and sent a couple Eldrich blasts at the Nagas and a pitched battle ensued which resulted in the death of one of the Naga and the escape of the other.  With the battle ended, the group made their way carefully to the entrance of the complex and entered.
