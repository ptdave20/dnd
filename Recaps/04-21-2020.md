The party took is easy for a few days spending time at the bar and the inn to recover from the nightmare dream.  The time wasn't completely uneventful, as Tamon received a request for a particular flower, that took a bit more to retrieve then he thought it would.  Trenton found out that Bastijn has been arrested for sedition and the party got a snarky message from Bob the Imp.  After recovering, the party headed out to retrieve the herbs that were quested by the Unknowing.
