I'm certain she likes me.   I was talking to her yesterday and she touched my arm and I'm sure I caught her looking at me from across the market.  It's more than I ever could have hoped but why am I still so doubtful?  Does she even realize that I've idolized her since the moment we met?  I have to find a way to meet her alone, somewhere away from the village where I can talk to her without everyone staring.  Maybe she'll agree for a walk in the forest; some place where I can get the courage to ask for the chance to court her officially.  I feel the butterflies in my stomach driving me to just run to her house and ask for her hand, but I have to be careful.  I know there are a thousand ways I could ruin this chance and I could never live without her radiant beauty in my life.  She is my perfect angel.  I have to get this right.

She agreed!  Oh wonderful and joyous day.  We will go for a walk together in the forest to a small pond about 2 miles from the village 1 week hence.  I could barely believe I was speaking the words.  Could she be as excited as I?  It seems impossible to be true, for if she was, we would have fallen into each other's arms at that very moment and pledged our lives to each other.  The seconds seem like hours, the hours like days.  How will I ever last until the time of our first date?  I must collect flowers, and prepare clothing.  Everything must be perfect, for she is perfect.

What has happened.  My world is spinning into oblivion.  I can barely put these words to paper.  Our walk happened as planned and it all seemed to be going wonderfully.  She accepted my flowers with grace and took my hand and we strolled through the woods, talking of the village and life and nature.  It was like a dream; my every hope and desire, my life completed in a single day.  We arrived at the pond and spoke for a while and then there was a moment of silence as we both watched the sun set low in the tree line.  I was positive the time was perfect.  I leaned in to kiss her, beginning our life of love together… and she pulled away.  She looked at me, my god, like I was a goblin.  A horrid creature to be reviled and hated.  How could she!  She tried to be polite, but she couldn't hide the revulsion in her eyes, the disgusted upturn of her mouth.  I pushed more forcefully.  I know that had we kissed, she would have felt what I felt, what I feel even now, but instead she pulled away as if I were an adder.  She stood to go and I tried to plead my case, but nothing.  She had just spat on my love and then…. then she struck me on the face.  I couldn't believe it.  My eyes clouded with rage.  How dare she curse me?  She had just rejected my very existence and then scorned me further, as if I was wrong?  I didn't mean to hit her back, it was just a reaction, an unthinking response to her vile rebuke.  She fell and I shook in horror at what I had done, but how much more was my terror when I realized that her head had struck a rock and she was dead.  
There was nothing else to be done.  I had to hide what I'd done.  I brought her back to my house and she is here with me now.  What do I do?

They all know.  I know they know.  Parties have gone out to search for her it's all a show.  They are waiting for me to crack, to admit what I did and accept blame, but I won't.  NEVER.  It wasn't my fault.  She made me do it.  How could she say no to me when I offered her never-ending love and adoration.  I know they are watching me; suspecting me.  I can hear their accusatory voices in my head, even when I'm alone in my house.  They can never find out.  They wouldn't understand.  They'll take her away from me….

I know what I must do.  Clarity has been spoken into my mind as if from god.  It's the only way we can still be together.  They will never understand our love.  They won't accept that this is how it had to be.  They all must die.  I touch my knife… so sharp.  It knows what must be done.  Where before it worked to provide my food, now it will provide for my safety.  Sharp.  So sharp.  I hear and I obey.  God has ordained me to reap my oppressors and has provided this sharp….. sharp blade for the harvest.

What a wonderful day.  I will head out into the woods to hunt for food and collect some firewood.  Perhaps I will even collect some flowers for my beloved.  I make sure each day to show her how much she means to me. 
It seems the latest travelers through the village have decided to stay permanently; how nice.  It's so wonderful to have so many friends here with me, together forever.  Truly my life is like a wonderful dream now that my beautiful angel is mine.  She becomes more radiant with each passing day.  Perhaps she will even indulge me to spend some time in revelry at the tavern with friends after my hard day's work.  I'm sure if I ask whilst presenting the bouquet of flowers she will say yes.  She never says no to me….
