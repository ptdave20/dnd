The group defeated the first stone golem, but realized quickly that the structure wouldn't be able to take much more damage.  They attempted to grab another item and seize the carafe at the same time, which caused all of the golems to activate.  As the complex began to fall apart, they rushed for the secret passage.  Unfortunately, the passage was blocked so Trenton started the teleportation spell.  The spell was still going when the passage began to collapse as well, but Mirthal channeled power from Osmadial and was able to shield the party until they could escape, at the cost of his life
Returning to the city, the group mourned their loss and got the reward for the treasure.  After shopping to replenish their adventuring supplies, the party was approached by Arlo, who indicated that the book they took had caused more trouble.  Returning to the house, they found it in disarray, but while trying to return the book, the ghost of Sid, who had been haunting the house, was absorbed into Brandong's ax, activating the weapon and giving it new, stronger powers.
