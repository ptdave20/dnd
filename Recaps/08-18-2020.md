The party threw caution to the wind and assaulted the Nagas, catching them by surprise and defeating them.  The party then withdrew to hide and rest and began their journey again.  Rounding the corner, Tamon found a trap, and with skill and wisdom, the group decided to let Brandong set the trap off and be damaged by it.  Brandong agreed quickly and was hit by a mighty blast of lightning.  The trap bypassed, the group moved forward cautiously, looking for more traps that Brandong could set off.  Soon though, they spotted another Naga, and prepared to fight once again.

Naga Loot - 300 gp, 600 sp, 1000cp.  One ornate necklace, one gold bracelet, a freshwater pearl, and a simple bear trap.
