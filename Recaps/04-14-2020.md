The party found themselves in a nightmare landscape, beset by all manner of foul creatures.  Despite a valiant defense the party was all slain.  At the moment Trenton was about to expire, he heard a thunderous voice growl "You have what's mine.  BRING IT TO ME!!!"  The party awoke in the inn where they had taken their rest, all exhausted by the experience.  Trenton's amulet was pulsing violently in rhythm with his heart and was ice cold to the touch, leading him to believe the collective nightmare was related to the influence of the dark artifact.
