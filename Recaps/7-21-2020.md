The group was able to dispatch the yetis without much trouble.  After this the party traveled northwest and arrived at the river that flows out of the lake of glass.  They considered the situation briefly and determined that a crossing would be too dangerous.  The group then retraced their steps back and came to the lake itself.  Arriving near the lake they encountered a mournful singing sound that was coming from a small cabin where an excentric old hermit lives.  A few members of the group spoke to the man and then gathered together to discuss what to do next.
