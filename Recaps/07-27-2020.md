The party tried to communicate with the hermit, but had little luck.  After a few tries, the hermit made a lame attempt to stab Onogug and Onogug killed him quite violently.  After this there was little to do but cross the lake of glass.  The initial crossing started well, until the lake began to crack.  The party retreated and tried again and once again the lake cracked further and a Kraken smashed through the ice intent on dragging the party to their doom.  The group narrowly escaped and are now on the far side of the lake of glass and close to their goal of the long forgotten temple.
