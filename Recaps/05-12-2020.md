All,

The party began to investigate the druid grove and then found that the mysterious skull door would port people who touched it inside the building.  Trenton was the first to have this happen and inside he discovered a magically altered hydra that would reflect spells back at the castor.  The rest of the group was slowly able to make their way inside, as the door required a few seconds to recharge before porting another person.  Inside the group was able to gather the herbs they needed, plunder some treasure and kill the hydra.  The problem was that the hydra's death seemed to ignite a huge thunderstorm that began to collapse the building.  The party was able to escape outside.  Upon exiting the building, the party discovered that Onogug, previously changed into a houseplant while trying to cast a healing spell was missing.  Unaware of where their companion had gone and unable to remain where they were, the party began to head south, back towards the city of Thiaca, hoping Onogug had gone that way ahead of them.
