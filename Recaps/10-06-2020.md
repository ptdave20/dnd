Tamon decided to try to sneak to the Unknowing, believing that would be safer than staying in the inn for the night.  He was able to make it with relatively few issues and secured a room.  The rest of the party tried to make their way to the Unknowing the next day but they were waylayed by a group of Argent guards and had to fight their way free.  Finally arriving at the Unknowing, Albon invited them to a great ceremony in the evening.  Upon arriving, they saw the bowl and knife they had retrieved and the carafe set on a large stone table.
Albon cast an enchantment and smashed the carafe with a hammer and a sparkling blue dust blanked the crowd, revealing a young woman with twinkling green eyes and long green hair.  The woman made some sort of contact with Trenton.  Albon however continued with his ritual, preparing to sacrifice the girl, but Trenton intervened, blocking the action with a spell.  Albon flew into a rage and stormed out of the room and the crowd began to become agitated now that it was apparent that things had not gone as planned
